## Start

I'm starting this blog because I hate failing.

Because I'm afraid to fail I rarely apply myself. Not to say that I'm some human vegetable. I like to _learn_ new things and get myself into situations that allow me to observe to my hearts intent; as long as I don't have to actually do anything. The idea of putting effort into a project just to have it fall through doesn't sound good to me.

I think one of the reasons it's so easy for me to not get anything done is that I don't like to project myself too much. I don't like the idea of someone forming an expectation of me based off something I said. I'd rather accomplish something and that be what my capabilities are judged on. But I don't really accomplish things that I want to show so I'm stuck in a loop.

This blog will _hopefully_ break me out of the loop. My reasoning is that by writing about my thoughts and goals and what I'm currently working on, I'll have established some expectations for myself in a public space. Even though it won't get as much as traffic as what I say on Twitter, it'll still be something that's out there and I'll feel accountable. That's the plan I'm starting with.

Honestly, I think this blog will really help my self-development. I feel like I learned a little bit about myself while writing this.

Most of my posts won't be this useless and introspective. I'll usually be posting about much lighter topics, like my views on the effect of technology on modern society (I'm a tech developer btw - more on that in later posts), random foolishness, and the inevitable end of humanity! :grimacing:
